# drkhrse Arcade Vertical Overlay
CRT overlay for vertical arcade games on TrimUI Smart Pro using [CrossMix-OS](https://github.com/cizia64/CrossMix-OS). I did not get a preconfigured SDCard so I made this set of additions that can be added to CrossMix OS to add a Veritcal Arcade system and did not want to use best collections. I chose to base it on FBNeo but you can utilize what I have here to change it to whatever system you prefer. Tested with the built in scraper and it seems to work ok for me.
