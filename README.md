# drkhrse Arcade Vertical CRT Overlay
CRT overlay for vertical arcade games on TrimUI Smart Pro using [CrossMix-OS](https://github.com/cizia64/CrossMix-OS). I did not get a preconfigured SDCard so I made this set of additions that can be added to CrossMix OS to add a Vertical Arcade system and did not want to use the Best Collections folder. This supports 4:3 and 16:10 (mainly because I felt like 16:10 was a good compromise between 4:3 and 16:9 for most schmups) aspect ratios with shaders with a crt-geom type of distortion. I chose to base it on the FBNeo emu config files, but you can utilize what I have here to mod it to whatever system you prefer. Tested with the built in scraper and it seems to work ok for me. The overlay itself could be used for other 16:9 systems like the Retroid Pocket 3/4/5 as long as you use the same shaders.
